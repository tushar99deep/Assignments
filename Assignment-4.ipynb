    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Index brackets ([]) have many uses in Python. First, they are used to define \"list literals,\" allowing you to declare a list and its contents in your program. \n",
    "Index brackets are also used to write expressions that evaluate to a single item within a list, or a single character in a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, \n",
    "how would you assign the value 'hello' as the\n",
    "third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "spam[2]='hello'\n",
    "\n",

    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "the value of spam is 8\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "bacon.index('cat')= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "bacon.append(99)= [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "after bacon.remove('cat') \n",
    "bacon = [3.14, 11, True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "The operator for list concatenation is +, while the operator for replication is *.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "append() adds an item to the end of a list, whereas . insert() inserts and item in a specified position in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "list_name.append(item)\n",
    "list_name.insert(position,item)\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "list.pop(<index>) – It is used to remove item of list using index. \n",
    "list.remove(<value>) – It is used to remove item of list using value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Both strings and lists have lengths: a string's length is the number of characters in the string; a list's length is the number of items in the list. \n",
    "Each character in a string as well as each item in a list has a position, also called an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are mutable. \n",
    "Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple. \n",
    "The contents of a tuple cannot change once they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "tuple1=(42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple () function can take any iterable as an argument and convert it into a tuple object. \n",
    "As you wish to convert a python list to a tuple, you can pass the entire list as a parameter \n",
    "within the tuple() function, and it will return the tuple data type as an output. \n",
    "sample_list = ['tushar', 'vishal', 'logan']\n",
    "\n",
    "#convert list into tuple\n",
    "tuple1 = tuple(sample_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a tuple into list in Python, call list() builtin function and pass the tuple as argument to the function. \n",
    "list() returns a new list generated from the items of the given tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "tuple1=(1,2,3,5,6,7)\n",
    "list1=list(tuple1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they\n",
    "contain?\n",
    "Variables will contain references to list values rather than list values themselves. \n",
    "But for strings and integer values, variables simply contain the string or integer value.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "The copy() returns a shallow copy of the list, and deepcopy() returns a deep copy of the list."
