    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "We can reduce the size of our code by using function i.e.\n",
    "if we have a code clock which is being used multiple time we can write that code block \n",
    "in a function, and instead of repeatedly writing the code again and again for different values \n",
    "we can just call the function with parameter which reduces the compilation and run time of our program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "A code in a function runs only when a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "A return statement created a function. A return statements is nothing but a values which \n",
    "will be returned, when a code in function runs upon function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "A function is procedure to achieve a particular result while \n",
    "function call is using this function to achive that task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many  scopes are there in a Python program? What is local variable scopes?\n",
    "There are 4 scope in python\n",
    "Local, Global, Built-in, Enclosed\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables created inside the function is called local variable. We can access local variable \n",
    "only inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "A local variable retains its value until the next time the function is called. A local variable \n",
    "becomes undefined after the function call completes. The local variable can be used outside the\n",
    " function any time after the function call completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "The a function return a value when its call is completed, this value is called a return value.\n",
    "Yes an expression can return a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example.\n",
    "def add(x,y):\n",
    "return x*y:\n",
    "\n",
    "the above expression in retrun will return x*y\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "A function will not return anything if there is no return statement, and it will not return anything even when it is called\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "We need to use keyword global while declaring the local variable inside the function.\n",
    "for example:-\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    global s\n",
    "    s = ' GFG'\n",
    "    print(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "None is not the same as 0, False, or an empty string. \n",
    "None is a data type of its own (NoneType) and only None can be None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic. \n",
    "(This isnâ€™t a real Python module, by the way.) \n",
    "This function can be called with spam.bacon ().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "This function can be called with spam.bacon ()\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "When program encounters an error, the control can be passed to the except block, \n",
    "skipping the code in between.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "The idea of the try-except clause is to handle exceptions (errors at runtime). "
