    "1. What is the name of the feature responsible for generating Regex objects?\n",
    "the feature responsible for generating Regex objects is provided by the re module, which stands for regular expression.\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Raw strings (r\"...\") are commonly used in regular expressions to handle special characters and escape sequences in a more straightforward and readable way. Regular expressions often contain metacharacters and escape sequences that have special meanings within the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using raw strings, backslashes (\\) are treated as literal characters, and no special interpretation or processing of escape sequences occurs. This simplifies the expression and avoids the need for excessive escaping or double escaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the return value of the search() method?\n",
    "The search() method in regular expression objects typically returns a match object if a match is found, or None if no match is found.\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r\"apple\"\n",
    "text = \"I have an apple and a banana.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "regex = re.compile(pattern)\n",
    "match = regex.search(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(\"Match found:\", match.group())\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No match found.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From a Match item, how do you get the actual strings that match the pattern?\n",
    "To retrieve the actual strings that match the pattern from a Match object, you can use the group() method. The group() method returns the string that matched the entire pattern or a specific capturing group within the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, calling group() without any arguments returns the entire matched string. If your pattern contains capturing groups (defined using parentheses), you can provide an argument to group() to retrieve the matching string for a specific group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the group() method to extract the matching strings:\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "pattern = r\"(\\d+)-(\\d+)-(\\d+)\"\n",
    "text = \"Date: 2023-05-16\"\n",
    "\n",
    "regex = re.compile(pattern)\n",
    "match = regex.search(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(\"Full match:\", match.group())\n",
    "    print(\"Year:\", match.group(1))\n",
    "    print(\"Month:\", match.group(2))\n",
    "    print(\"Day:\", match.group(3))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. In the regex which created from the r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', what does group zero cover? Group 2? Group 1?\n",
    "In the regular expression r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)', the group numbering is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 0 (or group(0)): It covers the entire matched string. In this case, it represents the complete phone number pattern matched by the regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 1 (or group(1)): It covers the first capturing group defined by (\\d\\d\\d). It matches and captures a sequence of three digits representing the area code of the phone number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Group 2 (or group(2)): It covers the second capturing group defined by (\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d). It matches and captures a sequence of three digits followed by a hyphen and four more digits, representing the phone number itself.\n",
    "pattern = r'(\\d\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d\\d-\\d\\d\\d\\d)'\n",
    "text = \"Phone: 123-456-7890\"\n",
    "\n",
    "regex = re.compile(pattern)\n",
    "match = regex.search(text)\n",
    "\n",
    "if match:\n",
    "    print(\"Full match:\", match.group(0))\n",
    "    print(\"Area code:\", match.group(1))\n",
    "    print(\"Phone number:\", match.group(2))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. In standard expression syntax, parentheses and intervals have distinct meanings. How can you tell a regex that you want it to fit real parentheses and periods?\n",
    "To match literal parentheses ( and ) or periods . in a regular expression, you can use the backslash \\ to escape them. For example, to match a literal period, you can use \\. in your regular expression pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",
    "The findall() method returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the input string. If the pattern contains capturing groups, each match is returned as a tuple of captured groups. If the pattern has no capturing groups, the method returns a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In standard expressions, what does the | character mean?\n",
    "In standard expression syntax, the | character represents the logical OR operation. It allows you to specify alternatives in a regular expression pattern. For example, a|b matches either the character a or the character b.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. In regular expressions, what does the character stand for?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the . character (dot) is a metacharacter that matches any character except a newline character (\\n). It is often used as a placeholder to match any character in a pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "10.In regular expressions, what is the difference between the + and * characters?\n",
    "In regular expressions, the + character represents the quantifier \"one or more.\" It matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element. The * character represents the quantifier \"zero or more\" and matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is the difference between {4} and {4,5} in regular expression?\n",
    "In regular expressions, {4} specifies an exact repetition count and matches exactly four occurrences of the preceding element. {4,5} specifies a range and matches between four and five occurrences of the preceding element.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What do you mean by the \\d, \\w, and \\s shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, \\d represents a shorthand character class and matches any digit (0-9). \\w represents a shorthand character class and matches any alphanumeric character (letters, digits, or underscores). \\s represents a shorthand character class and matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What do means by \\D, \\W, and \\S shorthand character classes signify in regular expressions?\n",
    "In regular expressions, \\D represents the negated shorthand character class and matches any non-digit character. \\W represents the negated shorthand character class and matches any non-alphanumeric character. \\S represents the negated shorthand character class and matches any non-whitespace character.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is the difference between .*? and .*?\n",
    "The .* pattern matches any character (except a newline) zero or more\n",
    "\n",
    "times, greedily. .*? is a non-greedy version of .* and matches any character (except a newline) zero or more times, but as few times as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the syntax for matching both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class?\n",
    "To match both numbers and lowercase letters with a character class, you can use [0-9a-z]. This character class matches any digit from 0 to 9 or any lowercase letter from a to z.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What is the procedure for making a normal expression in regax case insensitive?\n",
    "To make a regular expression case-insensitive, you can pass the re.IGNORECASE flag as the second argument to the re.compile() function. For example, regex = re.compile(pattern, re.IGNORECASE) will create a case-insensitive regular expression object.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. What does the . character normally match? What does it match if re.DOTALL is passed as 2nd argument in re.compile()?\n",
    "The . character normally matches any character except a newline. If re.DOTALL is passed as the second argument in re.compile(), the . character will match any character, including a newline.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. If numReg = re.compile(r'\\d+'), what will numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') return?\n",
    "The numRegex.sub('X', '11 drummers, 10 pipers, five rings, 4 hen') call will return the string 'X drummers, X pipers, five rings, X hen'. It replaces all occurrences of one or more digits with the letter 'X' in the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "19. What does passing re.VERBOSE as the 2nd argument to re.compile() allow to do?\n",
    "Passing re.VERBOSE as the second argument to re.compile() allows you to write regular expressions in a more readable and organized manner. It ignores whitespace and comments within the pattern, making it easier to add comments and break down the expression into multiple lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How would you write a regex that match a number with comma for every three digits? It must match the given following:\n",
    "'42'\n",
    "'1,234'\n",
    "'6,368,745'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'12,34,567' (which has only two digits between the commas)\n",
    "'1234' (which lacks commas)\n",
    "\n",
    "To match a number with a comma for every three digits, you can use the regular expression pattern r'^\\d{1,3}(,\\d{3})*$'.\n",
    "\n",
    "21. How would you write a regex that matches the full name of someone whose last name is Watanabe? You can assume that the first name that comes before it will always be one word that begins with a capital letter. The regex must match the following:\n",
    "'Haruto Watanabe'\n",
    "'Alice Watanabe'\n",
    "'RoboCop Watanabe'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'haruto Watanabe' (where the first name is not capitalized)\n",
    "'Mr. Watanabe' (where the preceding word has a nonletter character)\n",
    "'Watanabe' (which has no first name)\n",
    "'Haruto watanabe' (where Watanabe is not capitalized)\n",
    "\n",
    "To match the full name of someone whose last name is \"Watanabe\" with the assumption that the first name will always be one word starting with a capital letter, you can use the regular expression pattern r'[A-Z][a-zA-Z]*\\sWatanabe'.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. How would you write a regex that matches a sentence where the first word is either Alice, Bob, or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
    "'Alice eats apples.'\n",
    "'Bob pets cats.'\n",
    "'Carol throws baseballs.'\n",
    "'Alice throws Apples.'\n",
    "'BOB EATS CATS.'\n",
    "but not the following:\n",
    "'RoboCop eats apples.'\n",
    "'ALICE THROWS FOOTBALLS.'\n",
    "'Carol eats 7 cats.'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To match a sentence where the first word is either \"Alice\", \"Bob\", or \"Carol\", the second word is either \"eats\", \"pets\", or \"throws\", the third word is either \"apples\", \"cats\", or \"baseballs\", and the sentence ends with a period, you can use the regular expression pattern r'(Alice|Bob|Carol)\\s(eats|pets|throws)\\s(apples|cats|baseballs)\\.' with the re.IGNORECASE flag."
