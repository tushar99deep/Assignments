    "1.What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
    "Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets ([]) creates a list. It evaluates the expression and generates all the elements of the list comprehension immediately. The resulting list can be accessed and used as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enclosing a list comprehension in parentheses (()) creates a generator expression. It generates an iterator that produces the elements of the list comprehension lazily, on-demand, as requested by the caller. The elements are generated one at a time, which can be more memory-efficient for large datasets."

    "\n",
    "Iterators are objects that implement the iterator protocol, which consists of the __iter__() and __next__() methods. They provide a way to access elements of a collection sequentially. Generators automatically implement the iterator protocol, allowing iteration over their generated values."

    "3. What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
    "A function is a generator function if it contains at least one yield statement. The presence of the yield statement indicates that the function is intended to be used as a generator. When called, a generator function returns a generator object, which can be iterated over to retrieve the values generated by the function."

    "4. What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
    "The yield statement is used in a generator function to specify a value to be generated and returned to the caller. It suspends the execution of the function, preserving its internal state, and allows the caller to retrieve the yielded value. When the function is resumed, it continues execution from where it left off, maintaining its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield statement allows the generator function to generate a sequence of values without having to compute and store them all at once. It provides a way to generate values lazily, on-demand, which can be more memory-efficient and time-saving, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences."

    "5. 5. What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
    "Both map calls and list comprehensions are used to generate new sequences by applying an operation to each element of an existing sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "map(function, sequence) applies the specified function to each element of the sequence and returns an iterator that yields the results. It provides a functional programming approach and is suitable when the operation is a built-in or user-defined function.\n",
    "\n",
    "List comprehensions, on the other hand, provide a concise and more readable way to create lists based on existing sequences. They allow for more complex expressions and conditions within the comprehension itself. List comprehensions are generally faster than map calls for simple operations.\n",

    "Map calls return an iterator, while list comprehensions return a list.\n",

    "Contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "Map calls apply a function to each element, whereas list comprehensions use an expression or condition to generate elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map calls provide a functional programming style, while list comprehensions provide a more declarative and intuitive approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Map calls can process infinite sequences, while list comprehensions require a finite sequence.\n",

    "List comprehensions often result in more readable and self-explanatory code, while map calls can be more concise for simple operations."
