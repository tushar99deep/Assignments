    "1. **What does RGBA stand for?**\n",
    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that represents colors using a combination of red, green, and blue channels, along with an alpha channel for transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **From the Pillow module, how do you get the RGBA value of any images?**\n",
    "To get the RGBA (red, green, blue, alpha) value of any image using the Pillow module, you can use the `getpixel()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the RGBA value of a pixel at coordinates (x, y)\n",
    "rgba = image.getpixel((x, y))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is a box tuple, and how does it work?**\n",
    "A box tuple is a tuple that represents a rectangular region or bounding box. It consists of four values: (left, upper, right, lower), where left is the x-coordinate of the left edge, upper is the y-coordinate of the upper edge, right is the x-coordinate of the right edge, and lower is the y-coordinate of the lower edge. The box tuple defines the region of interest within an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use your image and load in notebook then, how can you find out the width and height of an Image object?**\n",
    "To find out the width and height of an Image object in Python using the Pillow module, you can use the `size` attribute. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the width and height\n",
    "width, height = image.size\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What method would you call to get Image object for a 100×100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter of it?**\n",
    "To get an Image object for a 100x100 image, excluding the lower-left quarter, you can use the `crop()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Crop the image to exclude the lower-left quarter\n",
    "cropped_image = image.crop((0, 0, 50, 50))  # Adjust the coordinates according to your needs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **After making changes to an Image object, how could you save it as an image file?**\n",
    "To save changes made to an Image object as an image file, you can use the `save()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make changes to the image\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the modified image\n",
    "image.save('modified_image.jpg')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What module contains Pillow’s shape-drawing code?**\n",
    "Pillow's shape-drawing code is contained in the `ImageDraw` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Image objects do not have drawing methods. What kind of object does? How do you get this kind of object?**\n",
    "The `ImageDraw` object has drawing methods for shapes and text. You can obtain an `ImageDraw` object by calling the `ImageDraw.Draw()` function, passing it the Image object. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from PIL import Image, ImageDraw\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open an image\n",
    "image = Image.open('image.jpg')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an ImageDraw object\n",
    "draw = ImageDraw.Draw(image)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use the drawing methods on the ImageDraw object\n",
    "draw.rectangle((x1, y1, x2, y2), outline='red')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the modified image\n",
    "image.save('modified_image.jpg')\n",
    "```\n"
