    "1. What is the concept of an abstract superclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is a class that is intended to be inherited from, but not directly instantiated. \n",
    "It serves as a blueprint for its subclasses, providing common attributes and methods that the subclasses can inherit and \n",
    "override. An abstract superclass often contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods without an implementation. \n",
    "Subclasses are required to provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):  # Abstract superclass\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):  # Subclass\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def calculate_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)\n",
    "print(rectangle.calculate_area())  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `Shape` is an abstract superclass with an abstract method `calculate_area()`. The `Rectangle` class is a subclass of `Shape` and provides an implementation for the abstract method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens when a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a class statement's top level contains a basic assignment statement, it creates a class attribute. \n",
    "Class attributes are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using either the class name or an \n",
    "instance of the class. If an instance attempts to access an attribute that is not present in its own instance namespace, \n",
    "it will look for the attribute in the class namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    wheels = 4  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "car1 = Car()\n",
    "car2 = Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(Car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "car1.wheels = 3  # Overrides the class attribute for this instance\n",
    "print(car1.wheels)  # Output: 3\n",
    "print(car2.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "print(Car.wheels)  # Output: 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `wheels` attribute is a class attribute. All instances of the `Car` class share the same value for `wheels`, which is initially set to 4. However, you can also assign a different value to `wheels` for a specific instance, as shown with `car1.wheels = 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why does a class need to manually call a superclass's `__init__` method?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class needs to manually call a superclass's `__init__` method to ensure that the initialization code defined in the \n",
    "superclass is executed. When a subclass defines its own `__init__` method, it overrides the `__init__` method of the superclass. \n",
    "To include the initialization code from the superclass as well, the subclass needs to explicitly call the \n",
    "superclass's `__init__` method using the `super()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "        super().__init__(name)  # Call superclass's __init__ method\n",
    "        self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Labrador\")\n",
    "print(dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\n",
    "print(dog.breed)  # Output: Labrador\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Animal` class has an `__init__` method that initializes the `name` attribute. The `Dog` class is a subclass of\n",
    "\n",
    " `Animal` and adds its own `__init__` method to initialize the `breed` attribute. To ensure that the `name` attribute is also initialized, the `Dog` class calls the `__init__` method of the `Animal` class using `super().__init__(name)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. How can you augment, instead of completely replacing, an inherited method?\n",
    "\n",
    "To augment an inherited method instead of completely replacing it, you can override the method in the subclass and call the \n",
    "superclass's version of the method using the `super()` function. This allows you to extend the behavior of the inherited method \n",
    "without losing the original functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shape:\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 0\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        base_area = super().area()  # Call superclass's area method\n",
    "        return base_area + self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)\n",
    "print(rectangle.area())  # Output: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Shape` class has a basic implementation of the `area` method that returns 0. The `Rectangle` class is a subclass of `Shape` and overrides the `area` method to calculate the area of a rectangle. However, before calculating the area, it calls the `area` method of the superclass using `super().area()` and adds it to the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How is the local scope of a class different from that of a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "The local scope of a class and a function is different in terms of visibility and accessibility. In a class, the local scope \n",
    "refers to the namespace of the class itself, which includes class attributes, methods, and variables. These entities can be \n",
    "accessed within the class using the `self` keyword or the class name.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, in a function, the local scope refers to the namespace of the function, which includes function arguments \n",
    "and variables defined within the function body. These entities are accessible only within the function and cannot be accessed \n",
    "from outside or from other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    class_var = \"Class variable\"  # Class attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, instance_var):\n",
    "        self.instance_var = instance_var  # Instance attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_method(self, local_var):\n",
    "        local_var = local_var * 2  # Local variable\n",
    "        print(local_var)\n",
    "        print(self.instance_var)\n",
    "        print(MyClass.class_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_obj = MyClass(\"Instance variable\")\n",
    "my_obj.my_method(5)  # Output: 10 \\n Instance variable \\n Class variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `class_var` is a class attribute, `instance_var` is an instance attribute, and `local_var` is a local variable within the `my_method` method. Each variable is accessible within its respective scope."
