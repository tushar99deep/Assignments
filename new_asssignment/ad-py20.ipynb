    "**Q1: Compare and contrast the float and Decimal classes' benefits and drawbacks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A1:**\n",
    "- Benefits of the `float` class: Efficient for representing and performing calculations on large sets of real numbers, built-in support in most programming languages and platforms, fast arithmetic operations, and suitable for many general-purpose applications.\n",
    "- Benefits of the `Decimal` class: Arbitrary precision, exact representation of decimal numbers, control over precision and rounding, and suitable for applications requiring high precision and accuracy.\n",
    "- Drawbacks of the `float` class: Limited precision, susceptibility to rounding errors, and not suitable for financial or precise decimal calculations.\n",
    "- Drawbacks of the `Decimal` class: Slower arithmetic operations and higher memory/storage requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A2:**\n",
    "These are not the same object. They represent the same value, but they correspond to different internal states. The trailing zeros in `Decimal('1.200')` indicate an exact decimal representation to the specified precision, while `Decimal('1.2')` represents a shorter decimal representation of the same value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3: What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A3:**\n",
    "If the equality of `Decimal('1.200')` and `Decimal('1.2')` is checked using the `==` operator, it will return `True`. The `Decimal` class compares the values of the decimals rather than their string representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4: Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A4:**\n",
    "It is preferable to start a `Decimal` object with a string rather than a floating-point value to ensure precise representation. Floating-point numbers, when converted to a `Decimal` directly, can introduce rounding errors and imprecise results due to the limitations of the binary representation of floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5: In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A5:**\n",
    "Combining `Decimal` objects with integers in an arithmetic expression is simple and straightforward. `Decimal` objects can be used in arithmetic operations with integers without any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6: Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A6:**\n",
    "Combining `Decimal` objects with floating-point values requires converting the floating-point values to `Decimal` objects first. Floating-point values can be converted to `Decimal` objects using the `Decimal` constructor, enabling them to be combined and used in arithmetic operations with other `Decimal` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7: Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A7:**\n",
    "An example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision using the `Fraction` class is `Fraction(1, 3)`. When represented as a `Fraction` object, it retains the exact representation without any loss of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8: Describe a quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by a floating-point value.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A8:**\n",
    "A quantity that can be accurately expressed by the `Decimal` or `Fraction` classes but not by a floating-point value is `1/7`. Floating-point numbers cannot represent `1/7` precisely due to the recurring decimal representation, resulting in rounding errors. However, both\n",
    "\n",
    " the `Decimal` and `Fraction` classes can represent `1/7` accurately without any loss of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9: Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A9:**\n",
    "The internal state of the two `Fraction` objects `Fraction(1, 2)` and `Fraction(5, 10)` is the same. Both fractions represent the value `1/2`. The `Fraction` class automatically simplifies the fraction to its simplest form, dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10: How do the Fraction class and the integer type (int) relate to each other? Containment or inheritance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**A10:**\n",
    "The `Fraction` class and the integer type (`int`) relate to each other through inheritance. The `Fraction` class is a subclass of `int` in Python, which means it inherits properties and methods from the `int` class. This allows `Fraction` objects to be used in place of `int` values seamlessly and enables operations between `Fraction` objects and `int` values."
