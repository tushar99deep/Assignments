    "Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that allows a class to inherit attributes and \n",
    "methods from multiple parent classes. In other words, a class can derive characteristics and behaviors from more than one base \n",
    "class. This enables the class to have a combination of features from different parent classes, promoting code reuse and \n",
    "flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method 1 from Parent 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method 2 from Parent 2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = Child()\n",
    "obj.method1()  # Output: Method 1 from Parent 1\n",
    "obj.method2()  # Output: Method 2 from Parent 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Child` class inherits from both `Parent1` and `Parent2`. As a result, instances of the `Child` \n",
    "class have access to methods from both parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the concept of delegation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Delegation is a programming concept where an object passes responsibility for a particular task to another object. \n",
    "In delegation, one object delegates a specific operation to another object to perform the task on its behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Worker:\n",
    "    def do_work(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Worker is doing the work.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Manager:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.worker = Worker()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def delegate_work(self):\n",
    "        self.worker.do_work()\n",
    "\n",
    "manager = Manager()\n",
    "manager.delegate_work()  # Output: Worker is doing the work.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Manager` class delegates the task of doing work to the `Worker` class by calling its `do_work` method. \n",
    "The `Manager` object doesn't perform the work itself but delegates it to the `Worker` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What is the concept of composition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Composition is a design principle in object-oriented programming where a class includes objects of other classes as member \n",
    "variables. It allows building complex objects by combining simpler objects and forming a \"has-a\" relationship. The composed \n",
    "objects are typically created and managed by the container object, and they encapsulate reusable functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Engine:\n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine started.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Engine stopped.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.engine = Engine()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def start_car(self):\n",
    "        self.engine.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    def stop_car(self):\n",
    "        self.engine.stop()\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car()\n",
    "car.start_car()  # Output: Engine started.\n",
    "car.stop_car()  # Output: Engine stopped.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Car` class composes an `Engine` object as a member variable. The `Car` class can then delegate the \n",
    "task of starting and stopping the car to the `Engine` object by calling its `start` and `stop` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are bound methods and how do we use them?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, bound methods are methods bound to an instance of a class. When a bound method is called, the instance is \n",
    "automatically passed as the first argument (conventionally named `self`). This allows the method to access and operate on the \n",
    "instance's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Value:\", self.value)\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass(42)\n",
    "obj.display()  # Output: Value: 42\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `display` is a bound method of the `MyClass` class. When `obj.display()` is called, the `\n",
    "\n",
    "obj` instance is automatically passed as the `self` argument to the `display` method. As a result, the method can access the \n",
    "`value` attribute of the instance using `self.value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of pseudoprivate attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudoprivate attributes, also known as name mangling, are a convention in Python where attributes with a double underscore \n",
    "prefix (`__`) are automatically modified to have the class name as a prefix. This is done to avoid accidental name clashes \n",
    "between attributes of different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of pseudoprivate attributes is to provide a form of name-based privacy. By mangling the attribute names, \n",
    "they become less accessible from outside the class, reducing the chances of unintentional name conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.__private_attr = 42\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __private_method(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Private method called.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "print(obj._MyClass__private_attr)  # Output: 42\n",
    "obj._MyClass__private_method()  # Output: Private method called.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `__private_attr` attribute and the `__private_method` method are pseudoprivate. \n",
    "Although they can still be accessed using the mangled names (`_MyClass__private_attr` and `_MyClass__private_method`), \n",
    "it is considered a convention to treat them as private and refrain from direct access from outside the class."
