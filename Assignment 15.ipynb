    "1. How many seconds are in an hour? Use the interactive interpreter as a calculator and multiply the number of seconds in a minute (60) by the number of minutes in an hour (also 60).\n",
    "   - The number of seconds in an hour is: 60 seconds/minute * 60 minutes/hour = 3600 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour.\n",
    "   - seconds_per_hour = 3600\n",
    "\n",
    "3. How many seconds do you think there are in a day? Make use of the variables seconds_per_hour and minutes_per_hour.\n",
    "   - There are 24 hours in a day, so the number of seconds in a day would be: 24 hours/day * seconds_per_hour = 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculate seconds_per_day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day.\n",
    "   - seconds_per_day = 24 * seconds_per_hour = 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.\n",
    "   - The result of seconds_per_day divided by seconds_per_hour is: seconds_per_day / seconds_per_hour = 86400 / 3600 = 24.0\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?\n",
    "   - The result of seconds_per_day divided by seconds_per_hour using integer division is: seconds_per_day // seconds_per_hour = 86400 // 3600 = 24\n",
    "   - Yes, this number agrees with the floating-point value from the previous question, except for the absence of the decimal point.\n",
