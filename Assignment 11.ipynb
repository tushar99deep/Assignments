    "1. **Create an assert statement that throws an AssertionError if the variable `spam` is a negative integer.**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert spam >= 0, \"Variable spam should not be negative.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables `eggs` and `bacon` contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different.**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "assert eggs.lower() != bacon.lower(), \"Variables eggs and bacon should not have the same value.\"\n",

    "4. **What are the two lines that must be present in your software in order to call `logging.debug()`?**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What are the two lines that your program must have in order to have `logging.debug()` send a logging message to a file named `programLog.txt`?**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import logging\n",
    "logging.basicConfig(filename='programLog.txt', level=logging.DEBUG)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What are the five levels of logging?**\n",
    "The five levels of logging, in increasing order of severity, are:\n",
    "- DEBUG\n",
    "- INFO\n",
    "- WARNING\n",
    "- ERROR\n",
    "- CRITICAL\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **What line of code would you add to your software to disable all logging messages?**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Why is using logging messages better than using `print()` to display the same message?**\n",
    "Using logging messages offers more flexibility and control over the output. You can easily enable or disable logging at different levels, log messages to files, include timestamps and other information, and customize the log format. Additionally, logging provides different severity levels to categorize messages based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?**\n",
    "- Step Over: Executes the current line and moves to the next line in the current function. If there is a function call on the current line, it will not step into the function but will execute it as a single step.\n",
    "- Step In: Moves the debugger into the next line of code, even if it is a function call. It will enter the called function and pause at the first line of the function.\n",
    "- Step Out: Executes the remaining lines of the current function and returns to the calling function, pausing at the line immediately after the function call.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **After you click Continue, when will the debugger stop?**\n",
    "The debugger will stop either when it reaches a breakpoint (a specific line in the code where execution pauses) or when the program terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **What is the concept of a breakpoint?**\n",
    "A breakpoint is a specific line in the code where the debugger will pause execution, allowing you to examine the program's state and variables at that point. It is a useful tool for debugging and analyzing code execution.\n",
